			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<h3>Purpose</h3>
			<p>For my personal website, I wanted to create a site that would help members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints as they prepare to give talks in church. It can always be really nerve wracking to prepare and share a talk in front of a large number of people and I wanted to help relieve some of that stress. The purpose of my site is to help individuals have access to different quotes that pertain to certain gospel principles. For example, if I was writing a talk about "faith", I could search this word and quotes that were related to this topic would appear and I could incorperate them into my talk. It will be a site for talk tips! :)</p>

			<h3>Audience</h3>
			<p>The general audiance for my wedsite will most likely be those from the ages of 18 - 65. Individuals in this age range will most likely want a little extra help and resources to find quotes that will help them write a talk. Mostly members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints will use this website but all followers of Christ are welcome to read and learn from the quotes that will be found on the website. Anyone who is looking for uplifting quotes for any reason, including preparing talks are welcome to visit my site.</p>
			<!-- change this -->

			<h3>Dynamic elements</h3>
			<p>For my website, I want to make sure to use Javascript to make it dynamic and fun! I am going to be including a dropdown menu that will filter the content on the page. I will also be using a search bar that is similar to our recipe project but it will be for key words when it come to quotes. I will use the Document Object Model throughout my website. I will also use the array method for all of my quotes. I will use event handling for things such as clicks and search submissions. I will probably also use conditionals so that different content can be shown based on the results of a search. These are just a couple of things that I want to use in my page to make it interactive and dynamic by using Javascript. </p>

			<!-- ------------------------Steps 4-8------------------------------ -->

			<h3>Color Palette</h3>
			<!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

			<p>Faith 
                “Doubt your doubts before you doubt your faith.” - Dieter F. Uchtdorf
                “Faith in Jesus Christ is the greatest power in this life. Your growing faith in Him will move mountains... Your flourishing faith will help you turn challenges into unparalleled growth and opportunity" - Russell M. Nelson
                “There is only one in whom your faith is always safe, and that is in the Lord Jesus Christ.” - Russel M. Nelson
                
                Repentance
                "Without repentance, there is no real progress or improvement in life. ... Only through repentance do we gain access to the atoning grace of Jesus Christ and salvation. Repentance … points us to freedom, confidence, and peace.” - D. Todd Christofferson
                “Repentance is always positive” - Russell M. Nelson
                “The Savior loves us always but especially when we repent.” - Russell M. Nelson
                Baptism 
                “The latter day saints are a covenant people. From the day of baptism through the spiritual milestone of our lives, we make promises with God and He makes promises with us. He always keeps His promises offered through His authorized servants, but it is the crucial test of our lives to see if we will make and keep our covenants with Him. - Henry B. Eyring 
                
                Holy Ghost
                “The baptism of water, without the baptism of fire and the Holy Ghost attending it, is of no use. They are necessarily and inseparably connected.” - Joseph Smith
                “We more readily receive and recognize the Spirit of the Lord as we appropriately invite Him into our lives. We cannot compel, coerce, or command the Holy Ghost. Rather, we should invite Him into our lives with the same gentleness and tenderness by which He entreats us.” - David A. Bednar
                
                Atonement
                “You need not know everything before the power of the atonement will work for you. Have faith in Christ, it begins to work the day you ask.” - Boyd K. Packer
                
                Forgiveness 
                “In refusing to forgive another, we, in effect, attempt to deny the blessing of the atonement to that person” - Roderick J. Linton
                “Forgiveness is powerful spiritual medicine. To extend forgiveness, that soothing balm, to those who have offended you is to heal. And, more difficult yet, when the need is there forgive yourself!” - Boyd K. Packer
